# Fedora i3 Config

This is a repo that I would use to automatically setup a minimal Fedora - i3 install. 

## Prerequisites

- Deja Vu Mono Nerd Font: https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads
- GruvBox Dark BL GTK Theme

## Scripts

- oninstall.sh: Run this when the system has been installed so that all packages and repos have been added.
- applyconfig.sh: This script places the necessary files in all the config directories.
- saveconfig.sh: This script saves all existing system configuration into the repository for upload.
